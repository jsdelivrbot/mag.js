#Tutorial

We'll be building a simple but realistic comments box that you can drop into a blog, a basic version of the realtime comments offered by Disqus, LiveFyre or Facebook comments.

We'll provide:

* A view of all of the comments
* A form to submit a comment
* Hooks for you to provide a custom backend

It'll also have a few neat features:

* **Optimistic commenting:** comments appear in the list before they're saved on the server so it feels fast.
* **Live updates:** other users' comments are popped into the comment view in real time.
