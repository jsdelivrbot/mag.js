# Tutorial: Introduction

You've heard about this UI library called MagJS and want to see what it's about.
Or maybe someone told you to come here. 
Either way, I'll try my best to show and teach you MagJS.

This guide assumes some familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Knowing what closures are and how "this" works in JavaScript will help but you'll learn MagJS regardless.

## Format

This is an interactive guide to MagJS. Between the text and bad jokes, you'll find embedded JSBin snippets to apply your new knowledge.

Oh look, your first exercise!

## Exercise: Hello

Give MagJS some personality by sprucing up this hello message. Perhaps some French to make it more romantic?

```js
mag("root", ()=>"Hello World!")()
```
